            <h2>Bexly</h2>
            <p>Meet my new best friend Bexley and her doll Who Let The Dogs Out! Her mom suggested the name Heidi (my personal favorite) but naturally, at the end of the day, the name Who Let The Dogs Out won (middle name Who Who). Bexley is 3, and fighting ALL, Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia. She was diagnosed in August of 2020, after feeling sick for several days. She is doing great throughout treatment so far, and her spunky personality continues to steal the hearts of those who meet her. Cancer picked the wrong kiddo! Oh Bexley we love you!</p></div>

            <h2>Lilly</h2>
            <p>Lilly was diagnosed at just three months old with Ewing's Sarcoma. Hours after finishing treatment she went into septic shock and almost didn't survive the night. Today, Lilly is seven years cancer free. She has faced challenges us adults cannot even imagine. Because of the harsh treatments she endured to save her life, Lilly must fight everyday to get to simply be a carefree child. Lilly’s heart extends far past herself. She is full of compassion and empathy for others fighting cancer. Her bravery and love reminds us all to live every day to the fullest.</p>

            <p>Indy fought relapsed leukemia at age 4. After several months cancer free, new leukemia cells were found behind her eye. Indy was a miracle, she continued to defy the odds. In 2020 she was told her bone marrow transplant failed, and there was nothing left that could be done, however with a storm of prayers from around the world, Indy was found to be cancer free. A few months later, Indy relapsed again, and passed away on June 3, 2021. She was and still is so widely loved and inspires those around her to be their best selves. Her story will continue on, teaching everyone who hears it all bout joy, love and faith. She is forever our hero.</p>

            <h2>Lucy</h2>
            <p>LLucy was only four years old when her family brought her in to the hospital for a fever and what was thought to be a sprained neck. After surgery and many weeks of treatment, new cancer lesions down her lower spine, on her brain stem, and on the right frontal lobe of her brain. She was officially diagnosed with stage four glioblastoma Multiform of the Central Nervous System. On May 13th, 2020, Lucy made her way to heaven after a five month battle. Glioblastoma is the most deadly form of brain cancer in children. Research is desperately needed in order to help kids like Lucy fight this monster. Lucy was sweet and goofy, and such a bright light in the world. She will never be forgotten.</p>
