              <h1>Basic HTML Animals </h1>

              <p>This is the first paragraph in our page. It introduces our animals.  </p>

                  The Llama
              </h2>
              <p>
                  Our Llama is a big fan of list items. When she spies a patch of them on a web page, she will eat them like sweets, licking her lips as she goes.

                  The Anaconda
              </h2>
              <p>
                  The crafty anaconda likes to slither around the page, travelling rapidly by way of anchors to sneak up on his prey.
